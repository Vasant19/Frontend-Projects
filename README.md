# Reference Code for JS Mastery Videos
Iâ€™m working on my JavaScript skills by tackling the projects from the JS mastery videos on YouTube. 
I know it can be tricky at times and Everyone can get stuck at errors, just by reading the commentsðŸ˜Š
So I thought itâ€™d be helpful to create a central spot where people can find answers and solutions to common roadblocks. 
Feel free to check out the code and use it as a reference!
